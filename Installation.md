> **Compatibility Note:** A-Frame does not support IE 9 and below.

## Standalone

Simply download and include with a `<script>` tag. `aframe` will be registered as a global variable.

_**Pro tip:** Don't use the minified version during development. You will miss out all the nice warnings for common mistakes._

<div id="downloads">
<a class="button" href="/js/aframe.js" download>Development Version</a><span class="light info">With full warnings and debug mode</span>

<a class="button" href="/js/aframe.min.js" download>Production Version</a><span class="light info">Warnings stripped, {{gz_size}}kb min+gzip</span>
</div>

### CDN

Available on [jsdelivr](//cdn.jsdelivr.net/aframe/{{aframe_version}}/aframe.min.js) or [cdnjs](//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/aframe/{{aframe_version}}/aframe.min.js) (it takes some time to sync, so the latest version might not be available yet).

## npm

npm is the recommended installation method when building scenes with A-Frame. It pairs nicely with a CommonJS module bundler such as [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). A-Frame also provides accompanying tools for authoring [Single-File Components](application.html#Single_File_Components).

```bash
# latest stable
$ npm install aframe
# dev build (directly from GitHub):
$ npm install mozvr/aframe#dev
```

## Bower

```bash
# latest stable
$ bower install aframe
```

## AMD Module Loaders

The standalone downloads or versions installed via npm/Bower are wrapped with UMD so they can be used directly as an AMD module.
